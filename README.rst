 jRally - Rally Integration for Java
-------------------------------------

This project is a simple Java interface to the Rally_ Agile Project
Management tool.  We have been using Rally for a little while at work
and I find it's user interface quite nice from a browser but difficult
to do anything useful with from a mobile device.  Since my carrier does
not support the iPhone, I am stuck with an Google Android derived phone
and there is not a decent Rally client for it.  To make a long story
relatively short, I decided to write one and this project is the work
in progress towards that goal.

I am relatively new to writing releasable Java programs beyond simple
utilities so expect to see some relatively non-standard coding styles as
I get beaten into submission by the JVM.

This is also my first play at using git_ and github_ for source control.
I am a long-time Subversion_ user so a distributed SCM is a bit of a
switch.
