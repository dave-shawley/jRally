<title>jRally - Rally Integration for Java</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="white">
jRally is a Java integration to the Rally Agile project management suite.

<p>I have been using Rally for a while at work now and find that while its user
interface is quite pleasant to use from a web browser, it is anything but 
usable from a mobile device.  There are also several problems with its ability
to print user stories nicely.  To make a long story short, I decided to write
some utilities to make my life a little easier and this project is the result
of that effort.</p>

<p>This is a first effort in a number of arenas for me.  First of all, I have
been a long time <a href="http://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a> user so
I decided to try something new and host this project on
<a href="http://github.com">github</a> and delve into the world of distributed
version control systems.  So, you can find the most recent version of this
project <a href="http://github.com/dave-shawley/jRally">on github</a> until
either (1) they start charging or (2) I give up and go home.</p>

<p>The next <i>first</i> for me is actually writing a Java project.  I am a
C++ programmer by choice and just started dabbling in Java recently so be
kind and accept all of the warts and ugliness that you are likely to find
herein.</p>
